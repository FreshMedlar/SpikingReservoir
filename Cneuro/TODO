EVOLVE THE MODEL TO BE LOG DISTRIBUTED

# RL:
**evolving variables**:
 1. generalThreshold
 2. generalBias
 3. generalRefractPeriod
 4. maxConnectionStrenght
**METHODS**
 1. Grid Search
 2. Random Search
 3. Hill Climbing
 4. Simulated Annealing
 5. Genetic Algorithms
 6. Gradient-Based Methods
**OBJ FUNCTION**
 1. Log-Normal distribution in the number of spikes
 2. 85% neurons active
 3. N of spikes in a range







MOST IMPORTANT
- graph for distribution of synapses strength, firing rates, firing per second
    and in general need to study the stability of the system

- there may be douplicates in the spike buffer (from manual input)

- synaptogenesis
    the development of new synapses is based on competition and various constraints.
    NOTE: this could also be impossible without ordered data. Rand spike won't do it 
    
    THEORY - The # of outgoing connection per neuron follow a log-normal distribution, this is an emergent property that we see when nodes compete (limited inputs are necessary/needed)on such task based, among many factors, on their current performance. This cause the resulting variable to compound, skewing the distribution.

- the synaptoGenesis function needs to be changed. Lonely neurons should remain such

- homeostasis

- LTP, LTD, track past activity

- move part of Neuron::disconnect to the rispective neuron

DONE
- pruning

# Day 50 - v0.0.1

Now simulations can be run in parallen and with different paramenters.
The environment has been enclosed in the Simulation class.
It's still a mess, but a usable one.
Next step is **refactoring**, cleaning and calculus exam :-(
Also need to make a **drawer class** for order.
