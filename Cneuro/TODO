### METHODS
 1. **Grid Search**
 2. **Random Search**
 3. **Hill Climbing**
 4. **Simulated Annealing**
 5. **Genetic Algorithms**
 6. **Gradient-Based Methods**

















MOST IMPORTANT
- graph for distribution of synapses strength, firing rates, firing per second
    and in general need to study the stability of the system

- there may be douplicates in the spike buffer (from manual input)

- synaptogenesis
    the development of new synapses is based on competition and various constraints.
    NOTE: this could also be impossible without ordered data. Rand spike won't do it 
    
    THEORY - The # of outgoing connection per neuron follow a log-normal distribution, this is an emergent property that we see when nodes compete (limited inputs are necessary/needed)on such task based, among many factors, on their current performance. This cause the resulting variable to compound, skewing the distribution.

- the synaptoGenesis function needs to be changed. Lonely neurons should remain such

- homeostasis

- LTP, LTD, track past activity

- move part of Neuron::disconnect to the rispective neuron

DONE
- pruning
