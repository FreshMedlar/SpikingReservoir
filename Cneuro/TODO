- synaptogenesis
    while the target neurons are easy to determine (low activity neurons)
    the complex part is determining which and why a neurons should develop new synapses
    This is also foundamental in creating a network with small-world properties
    NOTE: this could also be impossible without ordered data. Rand spike won't do it 
- homeostasis
- LTP, LTD, track past activity

- make the potentiation and rewiring dynamic
    thesis - we could see small-world by tuning the backpropagation parameters
- move part of Neuron::disconnect to the rispective neuron

DONE
- pruning
