- synaptogenesis
    the development of new synapses is based on competition and various constraints.
    NOTE: this could also be impossible without ordered data. Rand spike won't do it 
    
    THEORY - The # of outgoing connection per neuron follow a log-normal distribution, this is an emergent property that we see when nodes compete (limited inputs are necessary/needed)on such task based, among many factors, on their current performance. This cause the resulting variable to compound, skewing the distribution.

- the synaptoGenesis function needs to be changed. Lonely neurons should remain such, and 

- homeostasis

- LTP, LTD, track past activity

- move part of Neuron::disconnect to the rispective neuron

- graph for distribution of synapses strength and firing rates

DONE
- pruning
