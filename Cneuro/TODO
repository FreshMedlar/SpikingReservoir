- synaptogenesis
    while the target neurons are easy to determine (low activity neurons) the complex part is determining which and why a neurons should develop new synapses.
    This is also foundamental in creating a network with small-world properties
    NOTE: this could also be impossible without ordered data. Rand spike won't do it 
    
    THEORY - The # of outgoing connection per neuron follow a log-normal distribution, this
    is an emergent property that we see when:
    1 - nodes have a normally distributed variable X that indicate their capability in a tank 
    2 - nodes compete (limited inputs are necessary/needed)on such task based, among many factors, on the current performance. This cause the resulting variable to compound, skewing the distribution (Example: normally distributed IQ, competition on salary)
- homeostasis
- LTP, LTD, track past activity

- make the potentiation and rewiring dynamic
    thesis - we could see small-world by tuning the backpropagation parameters
- move part of Neuron::disconnect to the rispective neuron
- graph for distribution of synapses strength and firing rates

DONE
- pruning
